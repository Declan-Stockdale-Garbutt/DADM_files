# Data and Decision Making (DaDM) subject assignments

## Assignments involved creating monte carlo simulations for various business scenarios

## Assignment 1
Simple Monte Carlo simulation of a project timeline

This project was a relatively simple simulation to find the probabilities of the length of a project using traingle distributions.
A more complex simulation was simulated where delays in early stages had flow on effects to later stages.

## Assignment 2
 More complex Monte Carlo simulation of a mining project for a 5 year period aimed at surviving rather than maximising profit. 
 
This project involved multiple external criteria such as an ongoing legal challenge that could be challenged or delayed which would have flow on effects to the mine operation. There was also an additional mine that could be discovered which also could impact future mining operations. Both possibilities have been accounted for and various decisions surrounding likelyhood of survival have been explored and discussed in the report which is available here
